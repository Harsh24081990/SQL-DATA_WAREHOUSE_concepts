- Oracle db can be accessed using 'Sql Developer' or 'Toad for Oracle'.
- Oracle Client needs to be installed if using Toad and want to see all the available db server names in a drop down list in toad.
- sql developer uses it's inbuilt JDBC driver, so it can be used without oracle client installation if we know the following details and don't need db list auto fetched in a dropdown.
    - Hostname / IP
    - Port (default 1521)
    - Service Name (or SID)
- If need to see the server (db names) auto fetched in the dropdown list then need to use **tnsnames.ora** file along with **oracle client**.
